## Overview
This is the first challenge I have completed with Frontend Mentor. I felt like as one of the challenges for Newbies, I should be able to complete this challenge. Though I did am some challenges, I am happy with my result. 

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

First and formost, I learned out to center a div. It was a challenge for me to figure out to to make my "card" div centered both vertically and horizontally. I also learned how to import google fonts, and refator my code in such a way that styled code is not repeated among numerous style rules. 

### Continued development

To continue working on this project, I would love to refactor it using Flexbox. While, I used it a bit, I am still not completely familiar with it and it's properties.
